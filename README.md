</div>

:wave: Hello everybody! I have created this application to generate a strong password from the terminal. 
The password is copied into the clipboard and can be pasted into sites and password manager. 
The application does not use graphical interfaces and does not show the password in clear text or save it in the fixed memory of the computer.
<p align="center"><b>Weak passwords are not allowed!</b></p>
<p>Passwords with at least 8 characters are generated including uppercase / lowercase letters, numbers and some special characters. the software does not allow you to change these criteria in order to not reduce the security of the passwords generated. After the password is generated, the application closes.
</p>
